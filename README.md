10-bit-RISC-Processor Computer Architecture-Project.

This project was designed for the Computer Architecture Course Project.

Built using Logisim and C++.

The task was to design a 10-bit single-cycle CPU with separate Data Memory and Instruction Memory.

There is a total of three parts to this Project.

1. ISA (Instruction Set Architecture)
2. Assembler
3. Single Cycle Processor
